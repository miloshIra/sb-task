# CSV Parser

This version employs dynamic file names, 
which means we can use any file name as input 
as long as the file structure 
remains as in the task requirements, so:

filename1 should be the sample file
filename2 should be customers file
filename3 should be the invoices file
filename4 should be the invoice items file

To run it just use:

```
python3 main.py filname1 filename2 filename3 filename4

```

Immediete exapmle:

```
python3 main.py customer_sample.csv customer.csv invoice.csv invoice_items.csv

```
